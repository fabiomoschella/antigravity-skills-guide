## Overview

Machine Learning Engineering bridges the gap between ML research and production systems. This chapter covers essential skills for building, deploying, and maintaining ML systems at scale.

### Skills Covered

| Skill | Purpose | Best For |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `@ml-engineer` | ML engineering | Model development, pipelines |
| `@mlops-expert` | MLOps | Model deployment, monitoring |
| `@feature-engineer` | Feature engineering | Data preparation |

## 42.1 ML Development with @ml-engineer

```text
@ml-engineer Design ML pipeline for fraud detection:

Requirements:
- Real-time scoring (< 100ms)
- Handle 10K transactions/second
- Continuous model updates
- Explainability required

Provide:
1. Model selection approach
2. Training pipeline design
3. Feature store architecture
4. Serving infrastructure
```

---

## 42.2 MLOps with @mlops-expert

```text
@mlops-expert Implement MLOps for our ML platform:

Current challenges:
- Manual model deployment
- No model versioning
- Data/model drift undetected

Provide:
1. CI/CD for ML
2. Model registry
3. A/B testing framework
4. Monitoring and alerting
```

---

## 42.3 Feature Engineering with @feature-engineer

```text
@feature-engineer Design feature engineering pipeline:

Use case: Recommendation system

Data sources:
- User behavior logs
- Product catalog
- Transaction history

Provide:
1. Feature store design
2. Real-time vs batch features
3. Feature versioning
4. Data quality checks
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Reproducibility:** Version data, code, models
2. **Monitoring:** Track model performance
3. **Testing:** ML-specific test strategies
4. **Documentation:** Model cards, lineage

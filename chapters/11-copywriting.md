## Best Practices Summary

### Clarity Before Cleverness
- **Don't Bury the Ledge:** Say the most important thing first.
- **Use Simple Words:** Write for a 5th-grade reading level to maximize comprehension.
- **Be Specific:** "Save $500/year" is better than "Save money."

### Know Your Audience
- **Speak Their Language:** Use the jargon they use, avoid the jargon they don't.
- **Focus on Their Problems:** Nobody cares about your product; they care about their problems.
- **Address Objections:** Answer the "But what about..." questions in your copy.

### Formatting Matters
- **Scan-ability:** Use bullet points, short paragraphs, and bold text.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Headlines should stand out.
- **White Space:** Give the text room to breathe.

---

## Reflection Points

1. **Brand Voice:** Is your voice consistent across your website, emails, and ads?
2. **Features vs Benefits:** Audit your landing page. Are you selling the drill (feature) or the hole (benefit)?
3. **The "So What?" Test:** Read your headline and ask "So what?". If you can't answer, rewrite it.
4. **Testing:** Are you guessing what works, or are you A/B testing your headlines?

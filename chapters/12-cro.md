## Best Practices

### 1. Test High-Impact Elements First

| Priority | Element | Potential Impact |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| High | Headlines | 20-50% lift |
| High | CTAs | 10-30% lift |
| High | Pricing display | 15-40% lift |
| Medium | Images | 5-15% lift |
| Medium | Copy length | 5-10% lift |
| Low | Colors | 2-5% lift |

### 2. Statistical Rigor

```python
# Minimum sample size calculation
import math

def calculate_sample_size(
    baseline_rate: float,
    minimum_detectable_effect: float,
    significance_level: float = 0.05,
    power: float = 0.8
) -> int:
    p1 = baseline_rate
    p2 = baseline_rate * (1 + minimum_detectable_effect)
    p_avg = (p1 + p2) / 2
    
    z_alpha = 1.96  # for 95% confidence
    z_beta = 0.84   # for 80% power
    
    n = (2 * p_avg * (1 - p_avg) * (z_alpha + z_beta)**2) / (p2 - p1)**2
    return math.ceil(n)
```

### 3. Document Everything

- Test hypothesis
- Implementation details
- Results and analysis
- Learnings and next steps
